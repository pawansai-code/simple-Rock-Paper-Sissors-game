# simple-Rock-Paper-Sissors-game
A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors CLI game in Python using basic control flow, random module, and class-based OOP design. It takes user input and pits it against an AI’s random move. Emoji representation included for fun!

This is a simple command-line Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using Python. The game leverages Python’s random module to generate AI responses, the sys module for clean program exits, and uses object-oriented programming principles with a class-based structure for clean organization.

Key Features:
•Command-line interface for user interaction.

•AI opponent that randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors.

•Emoji display for visual fun.

•Graceful exit with "exit" command.

•Clear input validation and error handling.

Python Concepts Used:
•random.choice() to simulate AI behavior.

•sys.exit() for program control.

•Dictionaries (dict) to store and retrieve emoji representations.

•Lists (list[str]) to maintain valid moves.

•Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Class, methods, __init__, and object instantiation.

•Conditional logic (if, elif, else) to determine outcomes.

•Loops and recursion for gameplay continuation and input validation.

•You can use this project to understand the basics of building interactive Python applications, practice OOP design, and enhance input/output control.
